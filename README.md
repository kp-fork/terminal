## Why BBARIT?

Most "AI IDEs" lock you into one model and one workflow. BBARIT is a **native terminal** that puts *every* AI coding agent in one place, gives them real tools (PTY, git, editors, databases, MCP, a browser), and lets them **work as a team** — coordinated by a transparent **mechanical broker**, backed by a knowledge base that gets smarter every session.

If you live in the terminal and want AI that actually *does the work* — designs, builds, tests, reviews, and merges — this is your cockpit.

## ✨ Headline: 🦌 Broker Agent — your autonomous AI dev/review team

Press one button and BBARIT opens **two real terminals** — a **Developer** (e.g. Claude) and a **Reviewer** (e.g. Codex) — and runs a **mechanical broker** between them that mediates the whole dev↔review loop. You give the goal; the pair designs, builds, tests, reviews, and merges.

**How the loop works**

1. The **developer** implements and **tests its own work**, keeps a project wiki, and appends a one-line `DONE` when a unit is genuinely finished.
2. The **broker** sees that signal, reads the `git diff`, **judges it mechanically** (source-growth, code-graph blast radius, sensitivity patterns, requirements progress — *no extra LLM cost*), and hands the change to the reviewer.
3. The **reviewer** reviews (Linus-style: direct, specific) and replies `APPROVED` or `REWORK: …` — and **owns the rework loop** until it's right.
4. On `APPROVED`, the broker **auto-commits and merges the isolated branch** (only if git checks pass); a failed merge is escalated to you.

**What makes it different**

- **No screen-scraping.** The two agents coordinate purely through **git** and the **Karpathy Wiki** — everything is tracked, reproducible, and reviewable.
- **The broker does the reading for them.** It reads diffs and review notes and **delivers the content directly** to each agent, so they spend tokens on work, not on opening files.
- **Worktree isolation.** Each harness runs on its own git branch + worktree, so it never pollutes your working tree — run **several features in parallel** and merge them later.
- **Multi-harness manager.** A full-screen workspace with a **project → harness tree**: spin up many dev/review pairs across projects, switch between them, each with its **own live status window** (Working / Done), broker log, and two terminals.
- **Hot-swap models any time.** Change the developer or reviewer agent mid-session; the new agent reads the wiki + git and **continues** the in-progress work.
- **Session persistence.** Harnesses are saved and **auto-restore on reopen/restart**, continuing exactly where they left off — including queued auto-merges.
- **Requirements traceability (RTM).** Every requirement is a tracked row, verified against *real* code + tests before anything is called done.
- **Self-improving.** Recurring review findings are promoted into permanent design rules, so the same mistakes get caught earlier next time.
- **Tiered knowledge.** Project wiki → global wiki → *other projects' code* when stuck — learning your own patterns.
- **You stay in control.** Agents propose; **merge & deploy require your approval.**

> One click → a Claude+Codex pair that designs, builds, tests, reviews, and records — while you just give the goal.

- First-class support for **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, Cursor, OpenCode, Ollama, Pi, Reasonix** — each in its own PTY session with independent model / flags / autonomy mode.
- Per-project agent settings, autonomy modes (normal / auto-accept / full-auto / yolo), and one-key switching.
- **AI Roundtable** (multi-model debate) and **Orchestra / LangGraph** workflow pipelines for decompose → fan-out → synthesize.

## 🖥️ Terminal & editor

- Real **PTY** terminal (portable-pty + Rust) with **WebGL** rendering, Unicode 11, ligatures, copy-on-select & right-click copy/paste.
- Multi-project, multi-terminal: dozens of projects, each with its own terminals, **resizable split panes** (tree layout), tabs, themes & fonts.

- **Database** — MySQL & PostgreSQL with schema browsing.
- **PM2 / process** monitoring with AI anomaly detection, and a server Hub.

## 📚 Knowledge that compounds

- **Karpathy Wiki** — a structured, two-tier (project + global) knowledge base your agents read first and write back to; kept small with per-topic files and auto-archiving.
- **Notes / knowledge graph** — markdown vault with wikilinks, backlinks, tags, and an Obsidian-style graph view.
- **Skills library** — thousands of curated skills, GitHub skill-pack import, and a built-in **Karpathy guidelines** pack (think-before-coding, simplicity, surgical changes, goal-driven).

## 🔌 Integrations & remote

- **Web Terminal** — open a full terminal, file explorer, and editor **from any browser** (phone or desktop) over a **Cloudflare tunnel**.
- **Telegram · Discord · Slack** — mirror terminal I/O and drive sessions remotely from your phone (passwords auto-masked).
- **Real-time Collab** — share a room code; **Kanban, notes, chat, browser URL, and bookmarks sync live** across your team via WebSocket + Cloudflare tunnel.
- **GitHub · Linear** unified Hub, full **SSH** remote-project terminals, and a built-in **Chromium browser** with an AI toolbar (inspect, console/network, page→Markdown, AI-fix).

## 🎨 Media, design & more

- **NanoBanana AI Studio** — 16+ design services in one panel (app icons, banners, logos, product/ad images, ad videos, cartoons, interiors, 360° product spins, web-page generation) powered by Gemini / Imagen / Veo.
- Screen capture (region select), clipboard image paste straight into the terminal, native video editor.
- Command palette, fully configurable keybindings (Octo / VSCode / IntelliJ presets), voice input (Whisper), 8 UI languages.

## 💻 Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **macOS** | Apple Silicon (M1 or later) |
| **Windows** | 10 / 11 (64-bit) |
| **AI CLIs** | Install the agents you want (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, etc.) — BBARIT drives them |
| **License** | Free — sign in with GitHub |

## 📥 Install

1. Download the latest build for your platform:
   - 🍎 **macOS (Apple Silicon)** → [github.com/bbarit/terminal/releases/latest](https://github.com/bbarit/terminal/releases/latest)
   - 🪟 **Windows 10/11** → [github.com/bbarit/terminal-win/releases/latest](https://github.com/bbarit/terminal-win/releases/latest)
   - or grab either from **[bbarit.com](https://bbarit.com)**
2. Launch and sign in with GitHub (free license).
3. Open a project folder and start a terminal — or press the **🦌 Broker Agent** button to spin up an AI pair.

Auto-updates are built in (Tauri updater) — you'll always get the latest.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Do I need an API key?** You use the AI **CLIs** you already have installed; BBARIT runs them in real terminals. (Some optional studios like NanoBanana use your own Gemini key.)
- **Which agents can the Broker Agent pair use?** Any installed CLI — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, Ollama, and more — and you can hot-swap either role mid-session.
- **Will it touch my repo without asking?** No — the Broker Agent works in an **isolated git worktree** and never merges or deploys without your approval. It only initializes git (with a notice) when needed for review.
- **Can I run more than one AI pair at once?** Yes — the multi-harness manager runs several dev/review pairs in parallel, each isolated and individually monitored.
- **Does it work over SSH / from my phone?** Yes — SSH projects work like local ones, and the Web Terminal + Telegram/Discord/Slack mirroring let you drive sessions from a browser or phone.
